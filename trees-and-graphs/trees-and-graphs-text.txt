Trees

- the root node is the node at the very top
- if a node has no children, then it is a leaf node
- the root has a depth of 0, every child has a depth of parentDepth + 1

- two types of traversal => dfs & bfs
- depth-first-search
    - preorder: operate before children
    - inorder: operate during children
    - postorder: operate after children
- 

Binary Trees

- all nodes can have at most two children. Referred to as left and right
- every node except the root has one parent
